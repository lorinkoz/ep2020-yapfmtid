## The agenda

1. Django in 2020
2. Django, multi-tenancy & you
3. The challanges ahead
    - The active tenant
    - Database, models & managers
    - Routing requests to tenants
    - The scope of everything else
    - Cross-tenant security
4. Yet another package for this

-   Mature, solid and battle tested.
-   For perfectionists (like you)
-   For people with deadlines (like you)

# Django, multi-tenancy & you

What do Django, multi-tenancy and you have in common?

---

## I have an hypothesis

--

The world is divided in two kinds of Djangonauts:

-   Those who **have done** multi-tenancy.
-   Those who **will be doing** multi-tenancy anytime soon.

## What is multi-tenancy

Software architecture in which a single instance of software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants.

A tenant is a group of users who share a common access with specific privileges to the software instance..ref[1]

## Types of multi-tenancy

---

Users exist in the context of tenants

.center[![Diagram of users inside tenants](images/diagram-users-in-tenants.png)]

---

Users exist at the same level of tenants

.center[![Diagram of users outside tenants](images/diagram-users-out-tenants.png)]

---

Users are equivalent to tenants (similar to single-tenancy)

## How do we get to it?

-   Many things to do, and do right.
-   Non trivial parts.
-   Help is very much appreciated.

---

## Package first?

-   There is a number of solid packages to help with the multi-tenancy problem in Django.
-   The whole idea of this talk came from my experience forking one of those packages.

.box[‚úã But let's not take a package-first approach]

Instead, let's pretend we're going to implement multi-tenancy from scratch, without the help of any package.

# The challenges ahead

layout: true

## The active tenant

---

We have to adjust our mindset:

.box[Most operations will now require a tenant to be considered **the active tenant**]

---

There are things that are currently tracked by Django as an **active something** independent of the request / response cycle. For instance: **timezone** and **language**.

We could use the same logic to also track the **active tenant**, so that we get at our disposal:

```python
tenant = get_active_tenant()
set_active_tenant(tenant)
```

---

.warning[What if, for some operation, there is **no active tenant**?]

We will have to answer these questions in a case by case basis:

-   Does this operation have sense in a tenant agnostic way?
-   Should we interpret the lack of tenant as an indication that the operation must be performed on all tenants?
-   Is the lack of a tenant a bug in this context?

---

Every part of the framework needs to be able to operate in the scope of the active tenant:

.left-column[

-   Database access
-   URL reversing
-   Admin interface
-   Cache
    ]

.right-column[

-   Channels (websockets)
-   Management commands
-   Celery tasks
-   File storage
    ]

And everything else...

# Database, models & managers

## Database architecture

---

.left-column-66[**Isolated:** Multiple databases, one per tenant]
.right-column-33[![Diagram of isolated tenants](images/diagram-isolated.png)]

---

.left-column-66[**Semi-isolated:** One database, one schema per tenant (PostgreSQL)]
.right-column-33[![Diagram of semi-isolated tenants](images/diagram-semi-isolated.png)]

---

.left-column-66[**Shared:** One database, tenant column on (almost) every table]
.right-column-33[![Diagram of shared database](images/diagram-shared.png)]

---

layout: true

## Isolated databases

---

Multi-database configuration in Django settings

```python
DATABASES = {
    "default": {...},
    "tenant1": {...},
    "tenant2": {...},
    "tenant3": {...},
    ...
}
```

---

Queries need to define the active tenant.

```python
order = Order(...)
order.save(using="tenant1")

Order.objects.using("tenant2").filter(...)
Order.objects.db_manager("tenant2").do_something(...)
```

.box[üôã How to control queries outside of your code?]

---

Django has a thing called database routers

```python
class IsolatedTenantsRouter:

    def db_for_read(self, model, **hints):
        active_tenant = get_active_tenant()
        return get_database_for_tenant(active_tenant)

    def db_for_write(self, model, **hints):
        active_tenant = get_active_tenant()
        return get_database_for_tenant(active_tenant)
```

---

**.red[Limitations]**

-   No cross-tenant relations.
-   No relation between tenants and shared data.
-   Increased costs of deployment.
-   Adding tenants require reconfiguring the project.

---

layout: true

## Shared database

---

All tenant-specific models require a FK to the model that controls the tenants:

```python
class SharedTenantModel(models.Model):

    tenant = models.ForeignKey(
        "tenant_app.TenantModel",
        on_delte=models.CASCADE,
        related_name="%(class)ss"
    )

    class Meta:
        abstract = True
```

---

Assign active tenant before creating a model instance:

```python
order = Order(...)
order.tenant = get_active_tenant()
order.save()
```

---

Use active tenant in all queries:

```python
# In regular queries
Order.objects.create(tenant=get_active_tenant(), ...)
Order.objects.filter(tenant=get_active_tenant(), ...)

# But also in related queries
some_customer.orders.filter(
    order__tenant=get_active_tenant(),
    ...
)
```

---

Set active tenant when saving a form / serializer:

```python
# Form
instance = OrderForm.save(commit=False)
instance.tenant = get_active_tenant()
instance.save()

# DRF Serializer
instance = serializer.save(tenant=get_active_tenant())
```

---

**.red[Limitations]**

-   Increased complexity of isolating the tenants.

---

layout: true

## Semi-isolated database

---

.warning[‚ö†Ô∏è HYPE WARNING]

Use PostgreSQL schemas.ref[1] to isolate tenants within a single database.

The concept of `search_path` allows for interesting combinations of isolated and shared data.
