# Django and multi-tenancy

--

What does it have to do with .emph[you]?

---

## I have an hypothesis

--

The world is divided in two kinds of Djangonauts:

1. Those who **are doing** multi-tenancy.
2. Those who **will be doing** multi-tenancy anytime soon.

--

.box[üî• Multi-tenancy is inevitable]

--

.box[ü¶â You don't come to it, it comes to you]

???

Oportunity usually presents itself as:

-   Something that works good for a single tenant, and can be smartly expanded to a multi-tenant architecture
-   A million dollar idea for a SaaS.

So, my dear audience, if you're not doing multi-tenancy in Django right now, I suspect that the oportunity can be just around the corner. So be prepared!

![Meme of "Is this a pigeon?" about multi-tenancy](images/pigeon-meme-multi-tenancy.png)

???

Now, before getting any deeper in the topic, and in case you're wondering what are we talking about, let's get on the same page on some definitions.

---

layout: true

## A tiny bit of theory

.bottom[
.footnote[.ref[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy]
]

---

**Multi-tenancy:** Software architecture in which a single instance of software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants..ref[1]

.right[![Diagram of multi-tenanacy](images/diagram-multi-tenancy.png)]

---

**Tenant:** Group of users who share a common access with specific privileges to the software instance..ref[1]

.right[![Diagram of tenants](images/diagram-tenant.png)]

???

-   Private environment
-   In a running shared software
-   Where one or many users interact in isolation

---

layout: true

## Types of multi-tenancy

---

???

Now, the relationship between users and tenants delineates some types of multi-tenancy we should be aware of.

---

Users exist **outside** the context of tenants:

.center[![Diagram of users outside tenants](images/diagram-users-out-tenants.png)]

---

Users exist **within** the context of tenants:

.center[![Diagram of users inside tenants](images/diagram-users-in-tenants.png)]

---

Users exist **as** tenants:

.center[![Diagram of users equalling tenants](images/diagram-users-equal-tenants.png)]

---

layout: false
class: middle center

![Meme of Boromir "One does not simply walk into Mordor" about multi-tenancy](images/boromir-mordor-meme-multi-tenancy.png)

???

How do we actually do this in Django?

[MEME]

Why?

-   Lots of things to do and do right.
-   Some of those things are non-trivial.

---

layout: true

## A package for multi-tenancy

---

.left-column[

-   There are multiple packages for handling multi-tenancy.
-   Yes, I made one of them<br/>(a fork, actually)
    ]

.right-column[
.right[![Lego castle](images/lego-castle.png)]
]

???

Do you need a package as foundation for your multi-tenant project? Most likely yes!

--

.box[ü¶â But none of them solves it all]

???

Because the topic is too complex and has many many sides.

---

.center[![Lego bricks](images/legos.png)]

???

-   Let's pretend we're going to implement multi-tenancy from scratch.
-   You'll get a package, but not the one you can install.

---

<p>Tired:</p>

> Give someone a fish and you feed them for a day; teach someone to fish and you feed them for a lifetime.

???

Most likely you've heard of the proverb.

--

<p>Wired:</p>

> Give them a package for a SaaS and they will make it; teach them the underlying principles and they will break it.

???

Now, the equivalent of this proverb applied to multi-tenancy would be...

[WIRED]

I consider a good thing that you are capable of breaking your SaaS. Only doing that you'll be able to rebuild it better for the benefit of us all.

# The challenges ahead

???

Briefly mention the challenges ahead:

-   Active tenant
-   Database architecture
-   Routing requests
-   The scope of everything else

---

layout: true

## The active tenant

---

???

This takes a change of mindset.

---

.box[We need to know which tenant is **the active tenant** üòé]

--

.left-column[

-   Database access
-   URL reversing
-   Admin site
-   Cache
    ]

.right-column[

-   Channels (websockets)
-   Management commands
-   Celery tasks
-   File storage
    ]

--

.warning[üëÄ Even outside the request / response cycle]

---

Django has a couple APIs we're likely familiar with:

|             |                          |                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| üåê Timezone | `get_current_timezone()` | `activate(timezone)` |
| üà∏ Language | `get_current_language()` | `activate(language)` |

--

We could also have:

|           |                        |                    |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| üè† Tenant | `get_current_tenant()` | `activate(tenant)` |

---

```python
# Drop-in replacement for threading.locals that works with asyncio
from asgiref.local import Local


_active = Local()

def get_current_tenant():
    return getattr(_active, "tenant", None)

def activate(tenant):
    _active.tenant = tenant
```

???

Here's a basic implementation example.

--

.warning[‚ö†Ô∏è The use of globals is generally discouraged]

???

Warning:

-   You shouldn't start creating globals for everything!
-   There is a reason why this pattern is so scarce in the Django codebase itself.
-   The more you depend on a global variable, the more coupled becomes your code, harder to test in isolation.
-   This would be an acceptable use case of an otherwise frowned upon pattern.

---

##### Two important questions to ask:

--

.box[What is the üß™ **type** of a tenant object?]

--

.box[What happens if for some operation there is<br/>üò∂ **no active tenant**?]

???

We can discuss this later...

# Database, models and managers

???

Once that we have the concept of active tenant settled, it's time to move to one of the most interesting parts of multi-tenancy...

---

## Database architecture

--

**Isolated:**<br/>Multiple databases, one per tenant

**Shared:**<br/>One database, tenant column on entry-level tables

**Semi-isolated:**<br/>One database, one schema per tenant (PostgreSQL)

???

This is the common knowledge you get on most info about multi-tenancy out there.

---

layout: true

## Isolated databases

---

.center[![Diagram of isolated tenants](images/diagram-isolated.png)]

???

One database for every tenant.

---

Multi-database configuration in Django settings:

```python
DATABASES = {
    "default": {...},
    "tenant1": {...},
    "tenant2": {...},
    "tenant3": {...},
    ...
}
```

---

Queries need to define the active tenant:

```python
tenant = get_current_tenant()
active_db = `get_database_for_tenant(tenant)`

customer = Customer(...)
customer.save(`using=active_db`)

Customer.objects.`using(active_db)`.filter(...)
Customer.objects.`db_manager(active_db)`.do_something(...)
```

--

.box[üôã Do this allow for some automation?]

---

Django has a thing called database routers:

```python
class IsolatedTenantsRouter:

    def db_for_read(self, model, **hints):
        tenant = get_current_tenant()
        return `get_database_for_tenant(tenant)`

    def db_for_write(self, model, **hints):
        tenant = get_current_tenant()
        return `get_database_for_tenant(tenant)`
```

---

**.green[Benefits]**

-   Optimized for isolation.

**.red[Limitations]**

-   No cross-tenant relations.
-   No relations between tenants and shared data.
-   Adding tenants require reconfiguring the project.

---

.center[![Scrooge McDuck in a pile of money](images/mcduck-gold.png)]

???

-   Increased costs of operations.
-   Scrooge McDuck might need to pay for your databases.

---

layout: true

## Shared database

---

.center[![Diagram of shared database](images/diagram-shared.png)]

---

.emph[Entry-level, tenant-specific models] require a FK to the model that controls the tenants:

```python
class SharedTenantAbstractModel(models.Model):

    tenant = models.ForeignKey("TenantModel", ...)

    class Meta:
        abstract = True
```

---

Assign the active tenant before creating a model instance:

```python
# Via model save
customer = Customer(...)
*customer.tenant = get_current_tenant()
customer.save()

# Via manager create
Customer.objects.create(`tenant=get_current_tenant()`, ...)
```

---

Scope the relevant queries with the active tenant:

```python
# In regular queries
Customer.objects.filter(`tenant=get_current_tenant()`, ...)
Order.objects.filter(`customer__tenant=get_current_tenant()`, ...)

# In related queries
some_product.orders.filter(`tenant=get_current_tenant()`, ...)
```

--

.box[üôã Do this allow for some automation?]

---

Tenant field could be automatically **assigned** via:

-   Default value for the field (a callable).
-   `ForeignKey` field subclass with a `pre_save` hook.
-   `pre_save` signal on relevant models.

--

Tenant scope could be automatically **queried** via:

-   Custom manager.
-   Custom queries.

---

**.green[Benefits]**

-   Optimized for scalability.

**.red[Limitations]**

-   Extra care to define tenant annotated models.
-   Extra care with tenant annotated queries.

---

.left-column[![Meme of brain not letting you sleep on scoped queries](images/brain-sleep-meme-scopes.png)]

--

.right-column[

-   Bookmark all your tenant anotated queries.
-   Unit test each one of them.
-   Make the test suite fail if any query is untested.
    ]

## Semi-isolated database

---

{{content}}]
.right-column-33[.right[![Diagram of semi-isolated tenants](images/diagram-semi-isolated.png)]]

.bottom[
.footnote[.ref[1] https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/ddl-schemas.html]
]

--

##### Schemas:

-   Layer between database and tables.
-   Equivalent to namespaces.

---

Search path defines the precedence of schemas:

.left-column-33[![Diagram of schemas](images/schemas.png)]
.right-column-66[{{content}}]

--

```psql
        SET search_path = tenant1, shared;
        SET search_path = tenant2, shared;
```

---

Your queries remain unchanged:

```python
Customer.objects.all()
Customer.objects.create(...)
```

--

.warning[üëÄ Increased technical challenge somewhere else!]

???

This is the hardest path to implement from scratch.

---

Requires a custom database backend in order to set `search_path` based on active tenant:

```python
from django.db.backends.postgresql import base as postgresql


class DatabaseWrapper(postgresql.DatabaseWrapper):
    def _cursor(self, name=None):  # Over simplified !!!
        cursor = super()._cursor(name=name)
        tenant = get_current_tenant()
        schemas = `get_schemas_from_tenant(tenant)`
        search_path = ",".join(schemas)
*       cursor.execute(f"SET search_path = {search_path}")
        return cursor
```

---

Requires a database router in order to control which models are migrated on which schemas:

```python
class SemiIsolatedTenantsRouter:
    def allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name, ...):
        tenant = get_current_tenant()
        if tenant is not None:
            return `app_is_tenant_specific(app_label)`
        return `app_is_shared(app_label)`
```

--

.warning[üëÄ The tweak is on migrations!]

???

This also implies that migrations can no longer be run project-wise, but on each schema.

---

**.green[Benefits]**

-   Optimized for isolation.
-   Allows relations between tenants and shared data.

**.red[Limitations]**

-   More magic than recommended by daily dose?
-   Extra care to define shared apps and tenant specific apps.
-   Extra care to define where to put users, sessions and ctypes.

---

.center[![Meme of crazy lady and cat about schemas and migrations](images/cat-lady-meme-schemas.png)]

???

-   Migrations now must be run in all schemas.
-   It takes discipline to do zero downtime upgrades.

---

layout: true

## Which one is the best?

## Reversing tenant-aware URLs

---

--

.box[üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to reverse URLs so that the tenant is included?]

--

For some cases it's simply not possible:

|     |                          |
| --- | ------------------------ |
| ‚ùå  | Inferred from the user   |
| ‚ùå  | Stored in the session    |
| ‚ùå  | Specified in the headers |

---

The only possible way is when the tenant is inferred from the URL itself:

|     |                     |                                        |
| --- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| ‚úîÔ∏è  | Via subdomain       | .emph[`tenant1`]`.example.com/view/`   |
| ‚úîÔ∏è  | Via subfolder       | `example.com/`.emph[`tenant1`]`/view/` |
| ‚úîÔ∏è  | Via query parameter | `example.com/view/?t=`.emph[`tenant1`] |

---

**Via subdomain**<br/>
Django only reverses the path, so the full domain of the tenant must be prepended.

**Via subfolder**<br/>
All URLs must be interpolated with the tenant. To make the subfolder transparent to the URLConf, a clever hack is required.

**Via query parameter**<br/>
All URLs must be appended with the query parameter.

---

layout: false

## Tenant-specific URLConfs

???

Bonus!

--

.box[üí° You can use different URLConfs based on the active tenant]

--

    def middleware(request):
        tenant = get_current_tenant()
*       request.urlconf = get_urlconf_from_tenant(tenant)
        return get_response(request)
    return middleware
```

---

class: middle
layout: false

# The scope of everything else

---

## Management commands

-   For new commands, you can include a tenant argument.
-   For existing, non tenant-aware commands, you can define a .emph[special command wrapper].

---

## File storage

-   You can define a custom tenant storage that organizes files per tenant.
-   If cross-tenant file access is a security problem for you, you will need a custom view to act as proxy for files and decide if the incoming request has access to the requested file.

---

## Cache

You can define a tenant-specific cache key function:

```python
# settings.py
CACHES = {
    "default": {
        ...
        "KEY_FUNCTION": "myproject.cache.get_key_from_tenant",
    }
}

# myproject/cache.py
def get_key_from_tenant(key, key_prefix, version):
    tenant = get_current_tenant()
    return "{}:{}:{}:{}".format(tenant, key_prefix, version, key)
```

---

## Celery tasks

You can pass the tenant to activate as one of your task parameters:

```python
@app.task(bind=True)
def some_celery_task(self, tenant_id, ...):
    tenant = get_tenant_from_id(tenant_id)
    activate(tenant)
    ...
```

---

## Channels (websockets)

-   Requires custom middleware to activate tenant from request.
-   Requires naming your consumer groups including the tenant (for proper cross-tenant group isolation)
